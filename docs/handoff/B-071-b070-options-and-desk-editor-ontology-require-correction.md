# B-071 — B-070 options and Desk Editor ontology require correction before S2 authorization

- **Raised:** 2026-09-02 by Lane B
- **Kind:** spec-defect
- **Phase:** 1
- **Blocks:** terminal verification of `B-070`; any fresh S2 authorization; Lane B beginning
  `T5`/`T6`, route-readiness, judgment-packet, or publication-decision implementation
- **Status:** Open
- **Lane A:** Acknowledged 2026-09-02. Implementation plan drafted at
  `docs/v1/V1-B071-CORRECTIVE-PLAN.md`, consolidating steps 1-9 into reviewable sections. DRAFT
  only — no governed tier (Register, Build Spec, Inventory, Modular_PRD, FN-GATES, RACI,
  crosswalk, `B-070`, work order) has been edited. Awaiting independent review (plan's own
  checklist) and Judge approval before §2-§8 execute or §9's lane transition is authorized.
- **Evidence:** `docs/handoff/B-070-lane-b-work-order-stale-s2-instruction.md` Options A/B;
  `docs/v1/V1-DECISION-REGISTER.md` `D-171`, `D-175`–`D-181`;
  `docs/v1/V1-BUILD-SPEC.md` §"S2 — Line assignment and four-eyes";
  `docs/Modular_PRD.md` `US-04a`/`US-05a`, `AC-05a`–`AC-08a`;
  `docs/governance/raci-involvement-matrix.md` §§3.1/8;
  `docs/governance/factory-route-operation-crosswalk.md` §§2–4;
  `docs/fn-specs/FN-GATES-01-05.md` §11;
  `docs/LANE-B-WORK-ORDER.md` §§1/2.2d; both supplied Editorial Stage/Task CSVs; Chief Editor/Judge
  clarifications supplied directly on 2026-09-02 and not yet represented in the repository

## What happened

Lane B independently reviewed the two S2 options Lane A drafted in `B-070`, then traced the terms
`Desk Editor`, `Editorial Desk Editor`, `Chief Editorial Desk`, and `Desk Chief` through the supplied
CSVs, the RACI journal, the current role/node catalogs, the Product requirements, the Build Spec,
and decisions `D-170`–`D-181`.

`B-070` correctly removed the historical D-164/D-165 packet as Lane B's "next code unit," but neither
of its authorization options is approvable as drafted after the Judge's clarifications:

- Option A adopts `D-181` unchanged, including a role/cardinality model the clarification corrects.
- Option B waits for every currently listed unresolved operation shape, including
  `OP-FINAL-SIGNOFF`'s absent `R`; the Judge has now explained that this absence is intentional
  because Final Sign-Off is an approval control over prior `R` work, not another work task.

The underlying category error is narrower than "two titles are aliases" and broader than a spelling
change. The evidence supports one Desk Editor actor role and one separate editorial-desk review
workcell/node. `D-175` promoted the workcell label `Chief Editorial Desk` into a second canonical
executor role even though the supplied CSVs contain only `Desk Editor`. Different RACI and gate
functions require different scope/node/workstream fields, not automatically different actor IDs.

### Terminology map

| Existing term | Current use | Corrected canonical treatment |
|---|---|---|
| `Desk Editor` | Supplied CSV actor; route/task RACI involvement | `ROLE-DESK-EDITOR`, the canonical actor role |
| `Chief Editorial Desk` | D-170–D-181 T5 workcell promoted to `ROLE-*` | Relabel as `NODE-EDITORIAL-DESK-REVIEW`; historical wording or workcell alias only |
| `Editorial Desk Editor` | Judge clarification; absent from current repository | Optional display alias for `ROLE-DESK-EDITOR`, not a new ID |
| `Desk Chief` | Historical B-068/D-170 alias | Keep historical unless the Judge separately approves it as a display alias |
| `Chief Editorila Desk` | Typographical variant; no repository use | Reject; never canonical |
| T5 `Assurance Preparation` | Internal virtual-node workstream preparing the T6 packet | Not IIA Line 3, external GRC acceptance, OD4 execution, `senior_reviewed`, or Sheet 2 Legal/Ethical/Risk work |

### Normalized target model supplied by the Judge

1. `T5-EDITORIAL-REVIEW` is a single route-selected virtual review: Desk Editor for
   `ROUTE-PROD-1`; Chief Journalist for the other named routes. A fallback reviewer is an internal
   judgment preparer, never a replacement for the route's human or external RACI `A`.
2. `T5-ASSURANCE-PREPARATION` is a separate parallel flow: the Editorial Desk Review node and the
   Chief Journalist review node each seal a separately attributable brief. It is internal
   preparation, not independent Line 3 assurance.
3. Both T5 workstreams are held before `T6`. A report cannot satisfy both merely because the same
   role participated; every act carries a distinct workstream/purpose code.
4. `T6` remains the natural-person Chief Editor's final judgment. Agent attempts to record the final
   T6 disposition remain refused. The complete T5 packet supplies the judgment-rule inputs that OD4
   would require before any future automation; OD4 remains deferred and is not a pipeline stage.
5. Sheet 1 `A` owns route/stage accountability. Sheet 2 `A` owns task accountability; where a task
   has no local `A`, the governed parent/milestone/stage `A` supplies the effective task `A`. Neither
   scope overwrites the other, and each scope has exactly one effective `A`.
6. `OP-FINAL-SIGNOFF` is a task-level approval control. Its `A` signs the completion evidence
   produced by required prior `R` work; `R = not_applicable` for the sign-off control itself, not
   `unknown`. The route/stage `A` remains separately recorded, and an external route authority still
   requires its own external acceptance or mandate record.

### Drift and gaps

| Finding | Evidence state | Why it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| `B071-R1` — B-070 Option A adopts D-181's stale T5 membership | VERIFIED against B-070 and D-181 | Would authorize the wrong role/node and workstream contract |
| `B071-R2` — B-070 Option B treats Final Sign-Off's absent `R` as unresolved work | VERIFIED against B-070/crosswalk; replacement meaning is Judge-supplied, not yet in tree | Would block forever on an executor the approval control must not invent |
| `B071-R3` — `ROLE-CHIEF-EDITORIAL-DESK` conflates an app workcell with the CSV `Desk Editor` actor | VERIFIED against both CSVs and the RACI catalog | Creates two artificial actor identities and false separation evidence |
| `B071-R4` — current one/two T5 cardinality is derived from route family instead of separate Editorial Review and Assurance Preparation workstreams | VERIFIED against Product/Build/RACI target rows; replacement is Judge-supplied, not yet in tree | Can omit assurance evidence or count one report twice |
| `B071-R5` — task `A`, stage `A`, fallback reviewer, and external authority are not consistently separated | VERIFIED across crosswalk/RACI/Product rows | Internal software can appear to overwrite human or GRC authority |
| `B071-R6` — no `docs/specs/ux/` artifact owns the Chief Editor publication workspace that must display both T5 workstreams and the T6 human control | VERIFIED by repository inventory | Functional text has no UI/UX consumer contract; implementation would guess |
| `B071-R7` — `LANE-B-WORK-ORDER.md` §1 still says `Eligible` means the lock is free, contrary to D-156 and live §5 | VERIFIED | Can turn nomination into execution authority or produce a false lane transition |

Graphify is mechanically current at `bcfc8bc`, but it correctly reproduces the repository's old
`D-181` semantics. That is semantic drift from the new Judge clarification, not a stale graph build.
Rebuilding before the source documents are corrected would preserve the same error.

## What you need

Apply one parent-first Lane A correction; do not patch each old decision independently.

| Order | Fix | Owner | Depends on | Verification |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Record one new current T5/T6 decision. Preserve `D-171`'s hold and partially supersede only the affected `D-175`–`D-181` clauses | Lane A / Judge | — | One lifecycle table states retained, re-derived, and superseded clauses |
| 2 | Normalize the ontology: retain `ROLE-DESK-EDITOR`; replace executor uses of `ROLE-CHIEF-EDITORIAL-DESK` with a mapped `NODE-EDITORIAL-DESK-REVIEW`; keep Chief Journalist distinct | Lane A | 1 | One actor role, one mapped workcell node; no label-based independence proof |
| 3 | Correct the accountability model and Final Sign-Off shape: task `A` and stage `A` are separate scopes; Final Sign-Off is an approval control with no `R` of its own | Lane A | 1 | Crosswalk no longer marks missing `R` unresolved; prior-work and external-acceptance refusals remain explicit |
| 4 | Replace route-family one/two cardinality with the two T5 workstreams and re-derive bundle membership, return/rerun behavior, metrics, security, and acceptance criteria | Lane A | 2, 3 | Editorial brief plus both assurance-preparation briefs are separately sealed; exactly one join performs `Drafted → Reviewed`; T6 stays human-only |
| 5 | Redraft B-070's choices: Option A becomes a bounded implementation of the corrected packet with no route enablement; Option B becomes route-specific readiness, not a global wait and not a Final-Sign-Off missing-`R` hold | Lane A | 4 | Neither option cites D-181's superseded clauses or an invented Final-Sign-Off executor |
| 6 | Add the Chief Editor publication-workspace UX specification under `docs/specs/ux/`, showing Editorial Review, Assurance Preparation, authority provenance, external records, disagreement, and the human T6 control | Lane A | 4 | UX refuses T6/publication until all required packet sections exist; agents cannot submit the human disposition |
| 7 | Propagate the fact, not a tally, through the Decision Register, Build Spec, Artifact Inventory if a UX file is created, `Modular_PRD` §8 and owning rows, FN-GATES, RACI, crosswalk, publication/transition specs, B-070, and the Lane B work order | Lane A | 1–6 | Tier sweep plus direct semantic comparison; historical bodies retained with lifecycle notices |
| 8 | Commit the complete source/curated-fragment packet, rebuild Graphify at that HEAD, run the full suite, then return this item for Lane B independent verification | Lane A, then Lane B | 7 | Graph nodes distinguish role/node/workstream; docs-drift passes at the same HEAD; `B-071` may then move from Open to Answered/Applied and later Verified |
| 9 | Only after independent verification, ask the Judge to select the corrected B-070 authorization option and formally move Lane B from `Eligible` to `Active` for one named run | Judge / Lane A | 8 | Fresh authorization names one unit, exclusions and DoD; live lane table names exactly one Active lane |

### Success criteria

- `ROLE-DESK-EDITOR` is the sole canonical Desk Editor actor role.
- `NODE-EDITORIAL-DESK-REVIEW` is a separate virtual workcell mapped to that role.
- Four-eyes and attribution compare executor identity, role, workstream, and evidence purpose; a
  different label or node name never proves independence.
- T5 completion requires the route-selected Editorial Review brief and both separately attributable
  Assurance Preparation briefs; no report is reused across purposes.
- Only the T5 join changes `Drafted → Reviewed`, exactly once.
- Only the natural-person Chief Editor records the T6 final disposition.
- Task `A`, route/stage `A`, internal fallback reviewer, and external authority remain separately
  queryable and never overwrite one another.
- Final Sign-Off cannot occur before required prior `R` work is complete; it carries no invented `R`.
- Internal Assurance Preparation is never presented as IIA Line 3, OD4 execution, external GRC
  assurance, the Legal/Ethical/Risk operation, or `senior_reviewed`.
- The Chief Editor UI displays both T5 workstreams, unresolved disagreement, authority provenance,
  required external evidence, and the human T6 decision control.

## What you did instead

Stopped at the lane boundary and recorded this new handoff. Did not edit `B-070` or any governed
source/derived tier, did not create a Graphify fragment, did not authorize or build S2, and did not
move Lane B from `Eligible`. `B-070` remains `Resolution: Applied`, not `Verified`; `D-171` remains
fully binding until Lane A records and propagates a corrected target and the Judge separately
authorizes one implementation unit.
