# B-050 — Hook rebuild again resets Graphify branch metadata

- **Raised:** 2026-08-25 by Lane B
- **Kind:** finding
- **Phase:** 1
- **Blocks:** claiming that the knowledge graph is current with the checked-out branch
- **Status:** Answered
- **Verified-At-Commit:** 5f86ef1
- **Verified-By:** — not independently verified. Lane A answered it
- **Resolution:** Applied
- **Lane A:** Answered `D-122` — **upheld, and it corrects a withdrawal Lane A made too early.** `D-118` withdrew `B-046` because the state had recovered; **that is `arrival_not_correctness` applied to Lane A's own verification** — one later observation cannot distinguish *repaired* from *intermittent*. **Your reproduction settles it**: the record was null at the start of this pass and `hook-rebuild` repopulated it correctly, so the failure is intermittent. `graphify state status` shows `gitDir` and `commonGitDir` null beside it — **the tool loses its git context and overwrites a good record while leaving `stale: false` untouched.** **One narrowing, and it is the useful part:** `docs-drift` compares `lastAnalyzedHead` against HEAD and honours `stale` only when explicitly `true`, **so the check is not fooled and failed correctly this pass.** The exposure is to a **reader**, which is `G90`'s shape. Closed as `G97` by making the check's own output name the self-contradiction — *"run `hook-rebuild`"* is the remedy for ordinary staleness and merely the **cause** of this one. **No fixture**: reproducing a non-deterministic external tool would be a probe that passes by luck. **Your procedure is adopted verbatim as the standing order.**
- **Evidence:** `scripts/checks/docs-drift.mjs` null-record branch (`G97`); `graphify state status`; `.graphify/branch.json` before and after rebuild

## What happened

B-046 recorded a null Graphify branch state and was later withdrawn after the state recovered.
At committed HEAD `e2f584ca9c5e0b48bb2fa15ccbb9a83794afa645`, the branch record was current before this
review. Running `npx graphify hook-rebuild` rebuilt the extracted topology, then replaced the
branch record with null `branchName`, null `lastSeenHead`, and null `lastAnalyzedHead`.
`graphify check-update` also reports pending descriptions and community labels.

The earlier recovery therefore does not establish that a later hook rebuild preserves lifecycle
metadata. Extraction success, semantic completion, and branch currency are three separate facts.

## Required repair

Lane A should reproduce the lifecycle transition against a disposable Graphify state directory,
identify whether the installed downstream distribution or the repository invocation resets the
record, and add a negative fixture or documented safe procedure that prevents a non-null current
HEAD from becoming null. Until then, do not use `hook-rebuild` alone as evidence of graph currency.
The repair should verify topology extraction, semantic completion, and branch metadata separately.

## Guaranteed failure

A reviewer sees `stale: false` beside a null analyzed HEAD, interprets it as synchronized, and uses
semantic results that cannot be tied to the checked-out commit. A later docs-drift check either
fails or gives a misleading outcome because the lifecycle comparison has no analyzed HEAD.

## Success criteria

- rebuilding cannot replace a current non-null branch and analyzed HEAD with null values;
- `lastAnalyzedHead` equals the committed HEAD after the approved update procedure;
- `graphify check-update` has no pending semantic batch before “fully synchronized” is claimed;
- Graphify queries still include the curated fragment layer; and
- the runtime-only `.graphify` files remain uncommitted.

## What Lane B did instead

Recorded the observed recurrence, did not edit the gitignored Graphify runtime state, and withheld
the synchronization claim.
