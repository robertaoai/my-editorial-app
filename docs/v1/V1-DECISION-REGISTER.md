# V1 Decision Register

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Status:** **Operative.** This is the authoritative record of what is approved for v1.
**Authority:** Chief Editor approval recorded 2026-08-18 against the recommendations in `docs/journal/2026-08-18-board-decision-sheet.md`.
**Scope of supersession:** the thirteen `docs/journal/2026-08-18-*.md` analysis files only — see §6. **The governing set is not superseded** and cannot be by this document.

## 1. Approval summary

| Verdict | Count | Effect |
|---|---:|---|
| **Approved — Board items** | 32 | Effective now, no follow-up |
| **Approved — design decisions** `D-01`…`D-14` | 14 | Effective now; three carry conditions `C-10`–`C-12` |
| **Approved — artifact decisions** `D-15`…`D-21` | 7 | Effective now, no follow-up |
| **Approved with conditions** | 12 | Effective now, **each carries a follow-up — §3** |
| **Deferred** | 2 | Not approved; preconditions stated |
| **Rejected** | 0 | — |

**53 decisions approved in total; 12 of them conditional.** Board items are `APD-*`, `B-P0-*`, `MFB-*`; design and artifact decisions are `D-*`.

**Approved unconditionally:** `APD-01`–`08`, `APD-10`; `B-P0-01`, `02`, `04`, `05`, `07`, `09`–`15`, `18`–`22`; `MFB-01`, `02`, `06`, `08`, `09`, `10`; plus the design decisions in §2.

## 2. Design decisions approved

| # | Decision | Effect on v1 |
|---|---|---|
| D-01 | **Tenancy boundary in the S1 schema.** Each paying customer is its own tenant; never grouped by shared email domain. Boundary only — no multi-tenant feature | S1 migration |
| D-02 | **`CR-15` scoped to AP-01/MVP.** The separately chartered POC surface was never in its scope | T0 documentation |
| D-03 | **`NG-02` is a v1 lock, not a permanent exclusion.** No Charter act required | T0 documentation |
| D-04 | **Single revenue rule.** Revenue may attach to the business and the service, never to a specific editorial decision | T1 placement |
| D-05 | **One editorial engine, two exposures.** The pipeline is never forked | Architecture invariant |
| D-06 | **Retraction is a publication.** A notice is an ordinary article citing the original, running the same gates. No new article states | S1 design |
| D-07 | **`on delete restrict`** replaces `on delete cascade` on `workflow_transitions.article_id` | Migration `0002` |
| D-08 | **Publication transaction record** covers automated and manual acts at equal fidelity; retraction targets inherit from the original | S1 design |
| D-09 | **Mirror-the-spread boundary:** channels the business published to, per the transaction record. Third-party amplification explicitly outside | T1 documentation |
| D-10 | **`FR-13` bypasses deliberation, not publication.** A binding order skips *whether to retract*, never the notice or its logging | T1 wording |
| D-11 | **Risk-tier dimension** on articles — `FR-11`, `SEC-05`, `B-P0-06` all depend on it | S1 migration |
| D-12 | **`event_type` + intent code**, two levels, free-text `reason` retained | S1 design |
| D-13 | **`PSK-10`** registers immutable audit reporting as Project Scope | T0 documentation |
| D-14 | **Report immutability:** an issued report is never edited or deleted; supersede with a new report citing the original | T0 documentation |
| D-15 | **`docs/v1/` named as operative** in `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/README.md` — nothing currently points to it (`G25`) | T1 |
| D-16 | **EMS audit citation resolved** — retain the report under `docs/governance/`, or annotate both citations to record it as unretained and name what stands in its place. **Never delete the citation** (`G26`) | T1 |
| D-17 | **Draft migration `0002` held outside `supabase/migrations/`** until all eight T2 decisions are settled. That directory is the apply set; "do not apply" is a note, not a property of the location (`G27`) | S0 |
| D-18 | **The 14 manual PoC templates become an owned work item**, sequenced after the charter and before the first engagement. Chartering authorizes the lane; templates make it operable (`G28`) | T3 |
| D-19 | **Artifact inventory attached to each sprint's Definition of Done** — a sprint is done when its named files exist, not when its prose is satisfied (`G29`) | T1 |
| D-20 | **Output contract added to `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`** — every analysis response ends with an Approve / Approve-with-conditions / Defer / Reject table in house vocabulary; conditions name their follow-up phase (`G30`) | T1 |
| D-21 | **A T1 execution runbook is produced first**, on the T0 pattern. T1 carries 20 items and no procedure; T0 carries 6 and has a full one (`G31`) | T1 |

### 2.1 One edit, four payloads

`A7`, `G5`, `D-15`, and `D-20` all modify `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`. They are **one edit with four payloads**, not four edits:

1. Repoint from the stale plan pack to the governing set *(`A7`)*
2. Cover `AGENTS.md`, not only `CLAUDE.md` *(`G5`)*
3. Name `docs/v1/` as operative *(`D-15`)*
4. State the output contract *(`D-20`)*

Opening those two files four separate times is four chances to leave them inconsistent — the same reasoning that makes the S1 migration a single design pass.

### Withdrawn during analysis — recorded so they are not re-raised

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| `G21` — "the two RACI models conflict" | They describe **different layers**: CSV roles are human (`A`), the five gates are virtual agents (`R`). With one natural person all human accountability collapses to the Chief Editor, so *"A is invariant"* is correct for v1 |
| Enum reconciliation of `pub_target` / `platform_type` | **Orthogonal axes** — automation capability versus channel identity. Merging them would destroy the distinction that makes the manual publication path expressible |

## 3. Conditions register — the 12 follow-ups

Every conditionally approved item, its follow-up, and where it lands.

| # | Item | Condition | Follow-up lands in |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-01 | `APD-09` | Limits approved in principle; the **numbers** are `B-P0-06`'s ten boundaries | **T3** |
| C-02 | `B-P0-03` | Manual collection only. No scraper, crawler, or platform automation | **T3** — standing constraint |
| C-03 | `B-P0-08` | Interim authority boundary; stands in for `OD1`. **Must stay labelled temporary** | **TX** — closes with `OD1` |
| C-04 | `B-P0-16` | Its "no customer self-service" exclusion is superseded by the P0-EVR charter. Settle `QB` first | **T3** |
| C-05 | `B-P0-17` | Window duration is `UNSET`. 30 days suggested, 14/60 brackets | **T3** |
| C-06 | `MFB-03` | Direction only. Final `FR-14` wording awaits PoC evidence | **T3 → T4** |
| C-07 | `MFB-04` | Interim Chief Editor authority. **Must stay labelled temporary** | **TX** — closes with `OD1` |
| C-08 | `MFB-05` | Compensating controls must **never** convert a negative `OD2` into an affirmative one. Charter hard stop survives | **TX** — closes with `OD2` |
| C-09 | `MFB-07` | A working default, **not legal advice**. Subject to contract and jurisdiction review | **TX** — needs `Q7` counsel |
| C-10 | `G22` Expression of Concern | **New public-facing editorial act.** Needs separate Board approval plus a fifth intent code | **T3** |
| C-11 | Publication records insert/read-only | Decide alongside audit **Step 5** | **T2** — S1 window |
| C-12 | Record evidences **non-performance** | Raises `TR-DM-03`'s bar from tracking to completeness evidence. Size in the S1 pass | **T2** — S1 window |

**Four conditions close only when an Open Decision closes** — `C-03`, `C-07`, `C-08`, `C-09`. None is dischargeable inside v1.

## 4. Deferred — not approved

| # | Item | Precondition |
|---|---|---|
| `B-P0-06` | 5–10 paid engagements | Its ten boundaries need real values: topic in/out list · spend cap · time stop-loss · payment mechanics · cohort and WIP limit · originality-search sign-off · exclusivity window default · named escalation contact · `Q7` legal placeholder · fixed review date. **All are decisions or numbers; none requires a build** |
| `B-P0-23` | Ghostwriting as a separate paid service | Needs its own scope, price, byline and rights terms before entering a packet |

## 5. Open — not closable by approval

| Item | Why | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| `OD1`, `OD2`, `OD3` | Not closable at scaffolding; the build produces the evidence | Production only |
| `OD4` | Retained and deferred as Proposer → Critics → Judge | Nothing in v1 |
| `Q1` | Line 1 roster shape | Needs `OD3` |
| `Q7` | `SEC-04`/`SEC-05` ownership — **no owner exists** | Production |
| `G15` / `GA5` | Data-protection regime; retention versus erasure | Needs external counsel |

**Chief Editor decisions still to make — 16.** `Q0`, `Q2`, `Q3`, `Q4`, `Q5`, `Q6`, `Q8`, `Q11`, `Q12`, `QA3`, `QB`, `QC`, `QD`, `QE`, `G23`, `G24`. See `V1-BUILD-SPEC.md` for which sprint each gates.

## 6. Supersession map

The thirteen files below **remain in place as the dated analysis record**. They are the audit trail for how these decisions were reached and must not be deleted. What changes is that they are **no longer operative** — where any of them differs from this register or `V1-BUILD-SPEC.md`, these two documents control.

| Superseded file *(`docs/journal/2026-08-18-…`)* | What it contributed | Why superseded |
|---|---|---|
| `sprint-readiness-consolidated` | S0 go/no-go; reconciled 9 commits and 5 governance files | Conclusions absorbed into the build spec |
| `board-packet-checklist` | Plain-language verdicts on 42 items | Verdicts now recorded in §1–§3 |
| `board-decision-sheet` | House-vocabulary verdict sheet | Its verdicts are now **approved**, not recommended |
| `first-engagement-lock-in` | Seven decisions for one client to publication | Folded into the POC lane, `B-P0-06` preconditions |
| `poc-charter-separation-and-revenue-model` | Charter separation; revenue rule | `D-04`, `D-05` |
| `transition-intent-vocabulary` | `event_type` + 22 intent codes | `D-12`; vocabulary retained by reference |
| `audit-model-and-remediation-plan` | CPA audit model, `GA1`–`GA9`, Steps 1–11 | `D-13`, `D-14`; steps mapped to phases |
| `consolidated-gaps-and-open-questions` | Timeline register, `G1`–`G24` | Phase structure carried into the build spec |
| `t0-execution-runbook` | Exact T0 edit procedure | **Still executable** — retained as the T0 working procedure |
| `storyboard-business-and-digital-twin` | Both lanes panel by panel | Confirmed gaps; no decisions of its own |
| `raci-human-vs-digital-twin` | Human `A` versus agent `R`; `G19`, `G20` | `D-11`; `G21` withdrawn |
| `retraction-as-publication` | Notice-as-article model | `D-06`, `G22` → `C-10`, `G23` → `D-10` |
| `publication-transaction-record` | Orthogonal enums; GRC completeness | `D-08`, `D-09` |

**Not superseded, and not supersedable by this document:** `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/source/*` (Charter, Addendum, Blueprint, Business Case), `docs/Modular_PRD.md`, and all of `docs/governance/*`. Those sit above this register in the precedence hierarchy.

### 6.1 The operative set is three documents — frozen

| Document | Answers |
|---|---|
| `V1-DECISION-REGISTER.md` | **What is decided** — approvals, conditions, deferrals, what remains open |
| `V1-BUILD-SPEC.md` | **What gets built, in what order** — T0/T1, S0–S4, out of scope, invariants |
| `V1-ARTIFACT-INVENTORY.md` | **What must exist** — every planned file, its phase, whether it exists today |

**No fourth v1 document will be created.** New findings are absorbed into whichever of these three owns the question. This rule exists because the failure it prevents already happened: the consolidated register fell six gaps behind while six new analysis documents were written around it, and the artifact inventory omitted `G30` one turn after `G30` was proposed. **Adding a document is not consolidation.**

## 7. Scope limits

Closes no Open Decision. Amends no governing document. Authorizes no code, schema, migration, or deployment — approval of a *decision* is not authorization to *build* it. `OD1`–`OD3` remain open; the `OD2` negative-resolution hard stop stands exactly as the Charter writes it.
